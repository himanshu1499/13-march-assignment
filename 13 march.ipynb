There are several methods for imputing missing data, including mean imputation, regression imputation, and multiple imputation.\n",

Multiple imputation involves generating multiple plausible values for each missing data point based on the available data and combining the results to obtain an overall estimate.\n",

Mean imputation can lead to underestimation of the standard error and biased estimates of the treatment effects if the missing data are not MCAR. Regression imputation can also lead to biased estimates if the imputation model is misspecified. Multiple imputation can provide more accurate estimates if the missing data are not MCAR, but it can be computationally intensive and requires making assumptions about the missing data mechanism."
